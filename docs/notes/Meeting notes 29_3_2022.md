- TA feedback and advice We should get more test coverage, ideally 50-60% We have an equal amount of code, yay Evan and
  bogdan should comment on merge requests and issues more Deadlines:
  April 8th Buddycheck Coding deadline Final code of conduct (we didn't make any changes so this is not relevant)
  Video Should show unique features for our game We can meet up with timur to do sort of a live presentation to get
  pre-feedback on the video April 1st Feedback reflection (15min)
  Live presentation We should book a room and tell timur where and when we're going to do it We should put credits for
  images we used in our code Retroactively add weights to our issues

- Shuffle front-end and back-end We don't need to assign people, if you feel you haven't done enough on either you can
  just choose to work on a specific part

- Discuss how assigning issues and setting deadlines affected group work We got most of the stuff done

- Planning meetings for the upcoming week Wednesday at 10am

- Chairman & Secretary for next week We're freeeeeeeeeeeeee

  Must-haves we need to get done -According to the example backlog, we're done. BUT:
  -Match history -Admin panel (should-have apparently)
  -Deleting activities -Clearing databases

# Questions for the TA
